Ok so everything looks ok on examination but of course your diabetes symptoms appear to be getting worse. The blood sugar today is 10 which is slightly high. Yes that's right. It looks like you didn't have a blood check recently and I think it would be worth checking it again. I do not want to change your medications just yet as this may just be a temporary change in your blood sugar control as a result of the cold you had. Ok that sounds fine. Great, I will send a request for the blood test. If you could come back to see me in a week time for review and we will take it from there. Is there anything else you would like to ask? No, that's fine. Thank you. Good bye. Bye have a good day.
