Good morning Mr Jones, please come in. Hi, thank you. How can I help you today? Yes, I think my diabetes is getting worse as I am passing a lot more water all the time. I keep going to the lu 5 or 6 times a night. Ok, so could you tell me a little bit more about it. When did it start to get worse? I would say about a month ago. I had a bad cold at the time. ok and have you noticed anything else out of the usual? My fingers are slightly more numb. Otherwise I had my eye check recently and that seems to be ok. How are your feet? Have you noticed any ulcers or redness? No, my feet are ok. I am seeing the podiatrist regularly. Ok that's fine. Shall we have a quick look at your eyes, feet and hands? Yes sure.
